# Relief Goods Tracking Feature

## Overview
This feature implements inventory validation to prevent deliveries when the delivery count exceeds available relief goods. The system will now validate inventory availability before allowing any delivery to be scheduled.

## Implementation Details

### Enhanced UI Features

✅ **Real-Time Remaining Stock Display**: 
- Shows remaining quantities after user input in color-coded format
- **Green**: Good remaining stock (>10 items left)
- **Orange**: Low remaining stock (1-10 items left) or high usage warning
- **Red**: Input exceeds available stock (shows excess amount)
- **Gray/White**: Exactly 0 remaining stock (using all available)

**Example**: If there are 500 rice sacks:
- Input 200 → "Remaining: 300 (Total: 500)" in green
- Input 500 → "Remaining: 0 (Total: 500)" in gray/white
- Input 600 → "Exceeds by 100! Total: 500" in red

✅ **Dynamic Form Validation**:
- Input fields change color based on availability vs requested amounts
- Green border: Valid quantity (within stock)
- Orange border: High usage warning (>80% of stock)
- Red border: Exceeds available stock

✅ **Live Updates**:
- Inventory display updates automatically when stock changes
- Real-time validation as user types quantities
- Tooltips show exact availability information

### New Functions Added

#### 1. `validateInventoryAvailability(requestedGoods)` - Firebase.js
- **Purpose**: Checks if there are sufficient goods in inventory for a requested delivery
- **Parameters**: `requestedGoods` object containing rice, biscuits, canned, and shirts quantities
- **Returns**: Validation result object with:
  - `isValid`: Boolean indicating if inventory is sufficient
  - `insufficientItems`: Array of items that have insufficient stock
  - `availableStock`: Current inventory totals
  - `requestedItems`: The requested quantities

#### 2. Enhanced `handleScheduleDelivery()` - App.js
- **Enhancement**: Added inventory validation before scheduling delivery
- **Behavior**: 
  - Validates inventory availability before creating delivery
  - Shows detailed error message if insufficient inventory
  - Prevents delivery scheduling when inventory is insufficient

#### 3. `updateInventoryDisplay()` - App.js
- **Purpose**: Updates the delivery form with real-time inventory quantities
- **Features**:
  - Fetches current inventory totals
  - Updates labels with color-coded availability information
  - Shows main inventory summary
  - Called automatically when inventory changes

#### 4. `setupInventoryEventListeners()` - App.js
- **Purpose**: Adds real-time validation to input fields
- **Features**:
  - Monitors user input in quantity fields
  - Applies color-coded styling based on availability
  - Shows tooltips with stock information
  - Updates validation as user types

#### 5. `updateInputValidationStyling()` - App.js
- **Purpose**: Applies visual feedback to input fields
- **Color Coding**:
  - Green: Valid quantity (within available stock)
  - Orange: Warning (using >80% of available stock)
  - Red: Error (exceeds available stock)

### How It Works

1. **User attempts to schedule delivery**: Admin fills out the delivery form with goods quantities
2. **Validation triggered**: Before creating the delivery, system calls `validateInventoryAvailability()`
3. **Inventory check**: Function compares requested quantities against current inventory totals
4. **Result handling**:
   - If sufficient: Delivery proceeds as normal
   - If insufficient: User sees detailed error message with shortage information

### User Experience

#### Success Case
When sufficient inventory exists:
- Delivery schedules normally
- Success message displayed
- Form resets

#### Insufficient Inventory Case
When inventory is insufficient:
- Warning modal appears with detailed information:
  - Title: "Insufficient Inventory"
  - Details: Shows each item with requested vs available quantities
  - Button: "Add Stock First"
- Delivery is prevented from being scheduled
- User is directed to add more stock to inventory

### Error Messages

The system provides detailed error messages showing:
```
Insufficient inventory for this delivery:

rice: requested 10, available 5 (shortage: 5)
biscuits: requested 20, available 15 (shortage: 5)

Please add more stock to inventory before scheduling this delivery.
```

### Testing Instructions

To test the feature:

1. **Setup Low Inventory**:
   - Login as MSWD user
   - Go to "Track Relief Goods"
   - Set low inventory amounts (e.g., Rice: 5, Biscuits: 3)

2. **Test Insufficient Inventory**:
   - Go to "Delivery Scheduling"
   - Try to schedule delivery with quantities exceeding inventory
   - Verify error message appears
   - Confirm delivery is not created

3. **Test Sufficient Inventory**:
   - Add more stock to inventory
   - Schedule delivery with quantities within limits
   - Verify delivery schedules successfully

### Technical Implementation

#### Files Modified:
- `firebase.js`: Added `validateInventoryAvailability()` function
- `app.js`: Enhanced `handleScheduleDelivery()` with validation logic

#### Key Features:
- **Atomic validation**: Uses existing inventory totals for consistency
- **Detailed feedback**: Shows specific shortages for each item type
- **Non-blocking UI**: Uses modern modal dialogs with SweetAlert2
- **Fallback support**: Includes basic alert() fallback for compatibility

## Future Enhancements

Potential improvements:
1. **Pre-validation UI**: Show real-time inventory status in form
2. **Partial delivery**: Allow scheduling with available quantities
3. **Reservation system**: Reserve inventory when scheduling (before actual delivery)
4. **Batch validation**: Validate multiple deliveries at once

## Dependencies

- Existing Firebase Firestore setup
- SweetAlert2 for enhanced user notifications (optional)
- Current inventory management system

## Error Handling

The system handles various error scenarios:
- Firebase connection issues
- Invalid inventory data
- Calculation errors
- UI notification failures

All errors are logged to console and appropriate user messages are displayed.
